I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in cybersecurity ,I'm eager to learn and grow in this field, utilizing my analytical and problem-solving skills to identify and mitigate security threats. With a strong foundation in computer systems and networks, I'm well-equipped to analyze security logs, identify potential threats, and respond to incidents effectively.

Some of the tools and technologies I'm familiar with include:

- SIEM tools like Splunk and ELK
- Network security protocols like TCP/IP and DNS
- Threat intelligence platforms and frameworks

## Objective

My journey in communications engineering  has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or junior soc analyst.
